SI699 Capstone: MSD Popularity Prediction

Relevant notebooks, in order:
- prep-data-search
- spotify-data-search
- retrieval-eval
- spotify-data-features
- data-merge
- reg-sampling

The other notebooks are foundational. The modeling one was used as basis for regression with sampling. The hybrid-model was a classification approach that was eventually abandoned. The PCA nb tries PCA, and uses that output in the Modeling nb. Deep learning was early on, but no more dev on that.
